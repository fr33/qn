# qn
The next generation modern computer machine quantum computing programming language.

Qn.-> as in Quantum, based on the infinite-decimal metric unit (qu),
     hence a computing variable to define any and every type of data, in 
     SPACE->MEMORY using the Computer Metric System as base to define
     the Quantum Data Model, with the Computing Transition Unit,
     It re-defines the traditional computer metric system to form a whole 
     new Quantum Metric System, therefore a new computer data scale.
     
      A Quibble is a Quantum Transition Unit, which is half-bit size,
      It is used to transition data from bit to qit. Qit is a 
      new Quantum Data Unit, witch is a quarter-bit size. Mathematically 
      speaking, n-qib would be the actual computing notation for a qit. 
      Qn (qu) is the computing variable to store infinite-decimally data 
      into a computer memory space, having in consideration the physical 
      aspects of the computer machine and the computer metric system being 
      Used today, an intermediary between the computer machine and the 
      programming language is needed to transition actual processing data
      to the Quboid data structure. Therefore a compiler will be used to 
      format binary data to quantum data, this compiler is called Quantu, 
      it takes machine code generated in processor,  and in the computer 
      memory  and  passes to CUBOID ready data structure.
